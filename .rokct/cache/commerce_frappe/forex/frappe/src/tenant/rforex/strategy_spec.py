"""Strategy specs, versions and the run/stop verdict — frappe-free pure
module.

**Strategy is data, not code.** A `Forex Strategy` names a family; a
`Forex Strategy Version` carries one immutable spec — the parameter set a
bot reads to know what to do. Publishing a version freezes it. Changing a
published strategy means publishing a NEW version, and every user stays on
the version they pinned until they choose otherwise.

That choice has one exception, and it is the reason a status field exists at
all: **a version can be blocked, and a blocked version stops the bot.** The
alternative — silently migrating a blocked user onto the next version — is
worse than stopping: it would change what someone's real money is doing
without them asking, and it would do it precisely at the moment we've
decided the thing they signed up for is unsafe. So blocking stops. Restarting
is a user action, on a version they picked.

Every judgement here is a pure function over dicts. The API files own
reading rows and writing them; nothing in this module imports frappe.
