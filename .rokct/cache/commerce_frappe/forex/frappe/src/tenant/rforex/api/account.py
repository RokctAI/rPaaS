"""Account dashboard: balance, open positions, history, and the derived
equity and margin level.

**Read this before adding a fallback.** Every number this file returns is
one a person looks at before deciding how much to risk, and one the risk
layer divides by. A wrong balance here is a wrong position size there. So
there is exactly one rule, and it has no exceptions:

    If the broker figures are not available, this raises. It does not
    return zeros, it does not return the last known values without saying
    so, and it does not return a shape with the numbers omitted and a
    `success: true` beside it.

Right now the broker figures are NEVER available, because no cTrader Open
API client exists in this repository. [_broker_snapshot] therefore raises
`NotImplementedError` on every call, and so does everything that depends on
it. That is the honest state of this endpoint and it is meant to be visible:
a dashboard that renders an error is a nuisance, a dashboard that renders a
confident fabricated equity is how an account gets sized off a number nobody
computed.

The arithmetic itself is real, tested and finished — rforex.margin, 39 unit
tests. The assembly below is written against it so that when the connector
lands, [_broker_snapshot] is the only function that changes.
