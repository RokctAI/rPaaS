"""
Seed data for `Scoring Rule` / `Risk Profile`, translating the design doc
(polaris/docs/credit-risk-algorithm.md, "Where this plugs in — backend") into
the rows the decision engine consumes.

Run once per site after install/migrate, e.g.:

    bench --site <site> execute {app_name}.polaris.tenant.decision_engine.seeds.seed_scoring_config

Seeding is idempotent: existing rows (matched by metric_name / risk_level) are
left untouched so operator-tuned values are never overwritten.

IMPORTANT — two rules are seeded DISABLED on purpose:

* ``disposable_income`` (the mandatory NCA affordability floor,
  `minDisposableIncome`): the design doc names the gate but gives NO numeric
  value, and inventing one is prohibited. Until an operator sets a real
  threshold and enables the rule, the engine fail-honests every application to
  "Pending" rather than pretending an affordability assessment happened.
* ``first_loan_max_amount`` (the cold-start ceiling, `firstLoanMaxAmount`):
  same situation — doc mandates the cap, gives no number. Cold-start
  applicants stay "Pending" until it is configured.

# The doc's seeding recipe: gates as knockouts, the four weighted components,
# plus the two named config values it requires but does not quantify.
#
# Component rows carry threshold=100 / "Greater Than or Equals" deliberately:
# the graduated scorecard ignores thresholds on weighted rows (it multiplies
# the pre-computed 0-100 sub-score by the weight), but if these rows were ever
# fed through the legacy binary ScoringEngine._apply_rules() a component would
# only earn its weight at a perfect sub-score — erring toward decline, never
# toward approval (CORRECTABLE_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_RULE_THRESHOLD).
