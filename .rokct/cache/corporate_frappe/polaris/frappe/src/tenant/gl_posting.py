"""
Posts real loan money movement to ERPNext's actual General Ledger via
Journal Entry - the doctype the accounting doctype ledger (fork-lending-
full-backend-plan.md, Phase 0) already established as a permanent Frappe/
ERPNext dependency for Polaris. See corporate/polaris/docs/gl-posting-report.md
for the full audit this module was built against: what's confirmed vs. not,
the historical-backfill decision, and the reconciliation check evidence.

Deliberately uses Journal Entry, not raw GL Entry inserts: Journal Entry is
ERPNext's standard user-facing double-entry document with real validation
(accounts must exist, debits must equal credits, company must match) -
using it means this module doesn't have to reimplement that safety net.

Deliberately does NOT invent chart-of-accounts structure: every account
this module posts to is read from Loan Product's own GL account fields
(loan_account, interest_income_account, interest_accrued_account) or
ERPNext's own Company.default_bank_account - if any of these are unset,
posting throws a clear error rather than guessing an account name. This
matches real upstream Frappe Lending's own make_gl_entries() behavior
(it throws the same way if a Loan Product's accounts aren't configured).
