class Loan(Document):
    """
    Polaris's own Loan doctype - forked from Frappe Lending's `Loan`
    (see corporate/polaris/docs/fork-lending-full-backend-plan.md, Phase 3).

    Per the Phase 0 GL decision, this is a plain Document - it does NOT inherit
    ERPNext's AccountsController and does not post GL entries. Running balances
    (disbursed_amount, total_principal_paid, etc.) are maintained directly by
    Loan Disbursement / Loan Repayment / Loan Write Off's on_submit hooks as a
    self-contained sub-ledger.

    Deliberately NOT ported from upstream: co-lending (loan_partner), NPA/IRAC
    classification fields (is_npa, classification_code - Phase 5), limit
    management, restructure tracking, moratorium handling (Phase 4) - none are
    exercised anywhere in polaris's or RokctAI_frontend's actual usage today.
