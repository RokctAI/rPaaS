    """
    Polaris's own Loan Refund doctype - forked from Frappe Lending's
    `Loan Refund` (Phase 4). Plain Document, no GL posting (Phase 0 decision).

    Deliberately does NOT mutate Loan's principal/balance fields on submit:
    a refund (excess payment or security deposit return) is a payout of funds
    already collected, not a change to what's owed on the loan - there's no
    evidence anywhere in polaris's lending code of a wallet/cash-side effect being wired up
    for refunds today (no doc_event hook exists for this doctype, unlike
    Disbursement/Repayment), so this stays record-only pending that being
    scoped as real work.
