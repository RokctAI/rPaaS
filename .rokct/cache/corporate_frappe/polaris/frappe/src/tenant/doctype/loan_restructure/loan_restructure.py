class LoanRestructure(Document):
    """
    Polaris's own Loan Restructure doctype - forked from Frappe Lending's
    `Loan Restructure` (Phase 4), trimmed hard: upstream's real controller is
    dominated by unaccrued-interest/DPD/NPA fields that only matter once
    interest accrual exists (Phase 5) - none of it is written by
    `RokctAI_frontend`'s `lifecycle.ts:createLoanRestructure`, which only ever
    sends restructure_type/date/reason/new_term_months/new_interest_rate and
    submits immediately with status "Initiated".

    `on_submit` only applies the new terms to the Loan when status is already
    "Approved" at submit time - since the frontend always submits with
    "Initiated", new terms are NOT applied automatically today. There's no
    separate approval action anywhere in polaris's lending code or RokctAI_frontend to flip
    status to "Approved" after creation - that's a real gap, not something
    this doctype can invent evidence for. Flagged in the Phase 4 report.
