    Folds in what used to be a separate override layer
    (overrides/loan_application.py, now removed) directly, since there is no more
    vendor base class to override:
    - KYC validation (Lead check)
    - Ringfencing rules (mobile app logic)
    - Auto-disburse on approval

    Deliberately NOT ported from upstream: Employee-branch validation,
    sanctioned-amount-limit aggregation, and the before_save() auto-Customer/
    Contact/Address creation flow - none of these are exercised anywhere in
    polaris's or RokctAI_frontend's actual usage today.

    Secured-loan collateral capture (is_secured_loan/description/
    declared_asset_value) WAS added later (secured-lending-brief.md) once
    real evidence surfaced that the live application form
    (RokctAI_frontend/app/handson/all/lending/application/new/page.tsx)
    already captures it - this is Polaris's own single-asset repossession
    model, not a port of upstream's multi-asset pledge/LTV system.
