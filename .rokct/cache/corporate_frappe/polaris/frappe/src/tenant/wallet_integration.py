def credit_wallet_on_disbursement(doc, method):

    Posts the disbursement to ERPNext's real General Ledger, then credits
    the User's Wallet when a Loan is Disbursed. GL posting runs FIRST and
    deliberately: if the Loan Product's GL accounts aren't configured,
    gl_posting.post_disbursement() throws, which aborts this on_submit
    hook (and therefore the whole Loan Disbursement submission) before any
    wallet balance is touched - real money moving without a matching GL
    entry is exactly the bug this exists to prevent (see
    corporate/polaris/docs/gl-posting-report.md).

    Wallet crediting itself is best-effort: paas's Wallet doctype isn't
    installed on every tenant (polaris is meant to work standalone), so a
    missing Wallet doctype must not roll back a loan that's already been
    correctly posted to the GL - same tolerance PaasOrderAnalyzer already
    assumes for decisioning.
